# robot-war
 Robot war created using C++ object-oriented concepts.
 
 Each robot belongs to a team and can move on a x-y axis. 
 The robots are initiated in start.txt, where each line includes the robot number, its team, and its initial coordinates.
 The program reads commands.txt and outputs the result of each command on the terminal.
